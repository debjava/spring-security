----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Unzip the contents of the code sample into your folder of choice

2) Open your console and navigate to the sample's root folder.

3) Type the maven package command:

mvn clean package

4) Navigate to the spring-security-3-legged-oauth-1.0-provider folder and type:

mvn tomcat7:run-war-only

5) Open a second console, navigate to the spring-security-3-legged-oauth-1.0-consumer folder and type:

mvn tomcat7:run-war-only

6) Now you should have access to the following URLs in your favourite browser:

Provider: http://localhost:8443/provider
Consumer: http://localhost:8444/consumer

Before running the test from the consumer, make sure you visit the Provider server
and authorise the use of the SSL Certificate. The Certificate is only for development
so it's not a trusted certificate. If you don't do this, the demo will NOT work.
